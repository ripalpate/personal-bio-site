        <p>Hi Everyone! I'm Ripal. Currently, I am student at NSS and learning to be a web developer. I am originally from India and moved to this country in 2003 and landed to Nashville. I have received my bachelors in Public Health Education from Middle Tennesse State University and masters in Healthcare Administration from Western Kentucky University. I enjoyed learning new things and gaining knowledge. After few years of managing and working in Assisted living facility, I decided to make career change. Technology is one of the evolving field. After researching careers in to technology field and guidance from my relative, I started to learn coding languages through online materials. Meanwhile, I heard about NSS and applied for the Part time bootcamp program.</p>
