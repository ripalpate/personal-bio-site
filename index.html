        <p>Hi Everyone! I'm Ripal. I am originally from India and moved to this country in 2003 and landed to Nashville. I have received my bachelors in Public Health Education from Middle Tennesse State University and masters in Healthcare Administration from Western Kentucky University. After few years of managing and working in Assisted living facility, I decided I am ready to make change. After researching careers in to technology field and guidance from my relative, I started to learn coding languages through online materials. Meanwhile, I heard about NSS and applied for the Part time bootcamp program. I enjoy and I am glad I made that decision. </p>
